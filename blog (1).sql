Construction workers build skyscrapers for businesses to flourish, facilities for people to use, and roads for people to travel to different places. Roads are integral to the construction industry because they are constantly used for people to go drive to places far away, and construction workers need them to haul heavy equipment by transportation. Of course, technology advances as time goes on, and now electric road construction is part of the industry. Both road and electric road construction carry differences in how they are created with the aid of heavy equipment. Both serve a purpose of putting drivers on the road, except one of them is for electric vehicles.', '[\"Road construction involves many workers creating new roads and fixing hazardous ones. This of-heavy-construction-equipment-and-their-us es provides a list of heavy construction equipment on road construction projects. Some heavy equipment that are worth mentioning are motor graders, which can level grounds in a balanced manner, asphalt pavers which can place asphalt to where it should be, and cold planers which have large mill-like structures that can collect asphalt and concrete. Of course, there are more heavy vehicles and equipment for this kind of labor, so construction workers have plenty to work with.\",\"Electric roads differ because these roads accommodate electric vehicles, which use chargeable energy instead of gasoline. The construction of electric roads relies heavily on equipment and vehicles such as ones that are electric versions that trade chargeable energy for gasoline and diesel usage. According to an article called \\u201cElectrified Construction Equipment Gaining Momentum,\\u201d Sara Jensen talks about smaller heavy vehicles being more suited for electric batteries compared to bigger vehicles that are best suited for diesel. On the plus side, electric heavy vehicles such as the L25 electric compact wheel loader will reduce emissions just as an electric non-commercial vehicle would. Having an electric version of a mini excavator is a better alternative for reducing emissions and getting work done at a more consistent pace, whereas large heavy vehicles are more for getting huge portions of the work done.\",\"Electric roads differ because these roads accommodate electric vehicles, which use chargeable energy instead of gasoline.

', 'During heavy vehicle inspections, it is important for fleet managers to ensure steps into making each inspection as efficient as possible. After all, no heavy vehicle inspection should be poorly inspected, or else people might run the risk of operating unsafe heavy vehicles. This is where preventive maintenance comes in, which would ensure that each inspection would run as efficiently as possible, so that no problems arise. Having preventive maintenance would help heavy vehicle inspections because well planned inspections would reduce costs that fleet managers might have for heavy vehicles if they inspect the vehicles poorly.', '[\"                  As mentioned above, preventive maintenance aids heavy vehicle inspections would reduce costs of maintenance. What other benefits does preventive maintenance have on heavy vehicle inspections? Below are some of the benefits:                                                                          \",\"                    Nothing is more annoying than having to pay for repairs. Repairs can be very expensive, which could be avoided if preventive maintenance was used to create efficient inspections. Fleet managers would be saving money this way, instead of wasting it on repairs.                                                                          \",\"                  Having preventive maintenance can help fleet managers create efficient inspections by ensuring that the vehicles are safe to use. This is important because people use these heavy vehicles for work, and if they are put in danger because the vehicles are not properly inspected, then it is the responsibility of the fleet managers that inspected them.                                                                          \",\"                    It can be costly to replace car parts for when fleet managers need to. Preventive maintenance makes it so that fleet managers would not have to replace parts as frequently, because no maintenance means the parts wear out faster. If the parts were out slower, then the cost would be more manageable.                                                                          \"]', '[\" Why Have Preventive Maintenance                                                                        \",\"  Preventive Maintenance is more cost effective than repair              \",\"   Preventive Maintenance can improve heavy vehicle safety                                                                        \",\"   Preventive maintenance can increase the lifespan of heavy vehicles                                                                        \"]', '', 1, '2022-10-07 17:09:40'),
